## Solution

This task is pretty straightforward ,, the author used LSB Encoding to hide the flag data inside the provided image

```
LSB (Least Significant Bit) Encoding
This is one of the most common techniques for hiding data in images. It involves modifying the least significant bit of each pixelâ€™s color channel to encode the secret message or flag. zsteg can detect this if the message is embedded in the LSB of the red, green, or blue channels.
```

so basically all we have to do is use `zsteg` to recover the flag
